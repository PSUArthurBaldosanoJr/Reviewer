                <h2>Understanding Humanities, Art, and Human Essence</h2>
                <h3>Lesson 1.1. Humanities and the Arts<br></h3>
                <p>In the age of <b>Instagram and Facebook</b>, it is very easy to come across a work of art which
                    is made, remade, or reused to fit a certain purpose or value. You must have pressed that “like” or
                    “love” button as you deem a graphic post so relatable. YouTube offers lots of tutorials and
                    techniques for painting, calligraphy, watercolor and others; lots of young artists have been
                    exposed to a wide range of art techniques because of them. Art and information is now within our
                    reach. There are so many sources available to learn from.<br><br>
                    
                    The downside of this quick information is that it is very scattered. We do not know which to prioritize and are unsure if we are getting the right information.<br>
                    
                    Art Appreciation on the other hand is a discipline offered in an academic to direct our<br>
                    
                    often ambivalent feelings toward art which is a good starting point: YOU.</p><hr>

                <p>The concept of <i>"humanity"</i> originally distinguished humans from animals and those considered
                    subhuman, such as barbarians and slaves. During the Middle Ages, a shift toward the divine
                    led to a reconsideration of humanity’s status in relation to God, emphasizing mortality rather
                    than superiority. This change influenced the rise of humanism, which balanced rationality and
                    freedom with an awareness of human fallibility, fostering responsibility and tolerance.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    With humanism’s rise, <b>artistic styles evolved through learning from, rather than imitating, the past</b>. 
                    This contrasted with the Renaissance, which sought to reconstruct historical ideals. Panofsky highlights 
                    that human existence and its records should not be seen as ends in themselves but as means for growth and 
                    understanding.
                </p><hr>
                        <h1>The Renaissance & Humanism</h1><br>
                        <img src="https://thefablesoup.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/athens.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>The Renaissance <b>(means literally as "rebirth")</b> (14th–16th centuries) was a rebirth of Greco-Roman culture, marked by renewed <b>interest in 
                    classical texts, learning, and understanding the natural world</b>. A key aspect of this period was <b>humanism, 
                    an optimistic philosophy emphasizing human potential and goodness</b>. Before the Renaissance, Christian Europeans 
                    saw humanity as sinful, but this era shifted focus to appreciating human talents as part of God’s creation. 
                    Humanism encouraged intellectual growth, personal responsibility, and artistic innovation, influencing both medieval 
                    thought and Renaissance ideals.
                </p><hr>    

                        <h1>The Northern Renaissance & Christian Humanism</h1><br>
                        <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/70/166770-050-8805ACF2/Christopher-Columbus-support-chromolithograph-Isabella-I-Spain-1884.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>The Renaissance began in <b>Italy, deeply rooted in its Greco-Roman heritage</b>. As it spread north to places like England, 
                    Germany, and Scandinavia, classical influences were less emphasized in favor of a deeper focus on Christianity, 
                    particularly its early foundations. This shift led to the rise of Christian Humanism during the Northern Renaissance.

                    Unlike earlier <b>Christian teachings that emphasized Jesus' divinity, Christian Humanism focused more on his human nature—his 
                    teachings, relationships, and suffering</b>. This perspective influenced religious thought and artistic expression across northern 
                    Europe.

                    One key result was a transformation in religious artwork. Earlier depictions of the crucifixion showed Jesus peacefully slumped 
                    over, symbolizing salvation through sacrifice. However, Christian Humanist artists portrayed him in visible agony, with a tightly 
                    twisted body, emphasizing his suffering. Those witnessing his death were depicted in deep grief, shifting the focus from salvation 
                    to the raw emotional and physical pain of the crucifixion.
                </p><hr>
                <p>Art is a human expression deeply connected to culture, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary. It explores identity, values, 
                    and emotions, allowing people to experience joy, sorrow, and clarity. Art connects the past, present, and future while being interpreted 
                    through history, anthropology, and literature. Its definition evolves with culture, making it a fluid and ever-changing concept.</p>

                <h3>Rachel Carson</h3>

                <p><b>Silent Spring is an environmental
                    science book by Rachel Carson</b>. Published
                    on <b>September 27, 1962</b>, the book
                    documented the environmental harm
                    caused by the <b>indiscriminate use
                    of pesticides</b>. Carson accused the chemical
                    industry of spreading disinformation, and
                    public officials of accepting the
                    industry's marketing claims unquestioningly.</p>
                <p>In the late 1950s, Carson focused on environmental 
                    conservation, particularly issues caused by synthetic 
                    pesticides. Her research led to Silent Spring, which <b>raised 
                    environmental concerns</b> among the American public. Despite 
                    fierce opposition from chemical companies, the book influenced 
                    public opinion, led to a U.S. <b>pesticide policy reversal</b>, a 
                    nationwide DDT ban for agricultural use, and inspired the 
                    environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S.

                <h3>Garrett Hardin</h3>

                <p>First posited in 1968 by American ecologist
                    Garret Hardin, the Tragedy of the
                    Commons describes a situation where
                    shared environmental resources are
                    overused and exploited, and eventually
                    depleted, posing risks to everyone
                    involved.</p>
                <h3>What did Garrett Hardin say about
                    the tragedy of the commons?</h3>
                <p>Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of
                    the commons that "Freedom in a commons
                    brings ruin to all." One of the proposed
                    solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate
                    access to the common.</p>
                <h3>What problem is Hardin discussing in the
                    tragedy of the commons?</h3>
                <p>Hardin wanted to address the "population problem".
                    Others want or hope to avoid the problems of
                    overpopulation without relinquishing any of the
                    privileges they now enjoy. They think that farming
                    the seas or developing new strains of wheat will
                    solve the problem--technologically.</p><hr>

                <h3>Earth day</h3>

                <p>During the 1960s, hundreds of thousands of
                    young Americans rejected the stable,
                    comfortable middle-class life their parents had
                    built in the years after World War II, driven
                    instead by a spirit of rebellion that would
                    leave a lasting impact on the nation.</p>

                <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, the environmental
                    movement focused its attention on pollution
                    and successfully pressured Congress to pass
                    measures to promote cleaner air and water. In
                    the late 1970s, the movement increasingly
                    addressed environmental threats created by
                    the disposal of toxic waste.</p>
                <p>But long hair and beards for men, tight bell-bottom
                    blue jeans and flower crowns for women, and the
                    widespread use of mind-altering drugs were only
                    the most visible, and easily dismissed, signs of this
                    ‘60s “hippie” counterculture</p>
                <p>Far more transformative were the radical social and
                    political movements that many of its adherents
                    embraced, including the civil rights movement, the
                    movement to oppose the Vietnam War and—at the
                    tail end of the 1960s and the outset of the 1970s—the

                <p>Rachel Carson’s bestselling book Silent Spring,
                    published in 1962, introduced many Americans to the
                    devastating effects of the large-scale use of
                    pesticides, especially DDT. As the 1960s continued,
                    more and more people became aware of other threats

                    Clean Air Act, the first federal emissions standards and
                    the first list of endangered species (including the bald
                    eagle, America’s national symbol). These laws were a
                    start, but they did not go far enough to address the
                    serious environmental problems facing the nation.</p><br>

                <p>In January 1969, the Union Oil well in Santa Barbara,
                    California spilled more than 200,000 gallons of oil into the
                    Pacific Ocean over 11 days. That June, oil and chemicals
                    floating on the surface of the Cuyahoga River in Ohio burst
                    into flames. Images of such disasters, broadcast across the
                    country, helped fuel a growing outrage over the state of the
                    environment, especially among young radicals.</p>
                <h3>What environmental disasters of the 1960s
                    and 70s led to the creation of
                    environmental laws in the US?</h3>
                <p>Along with the Santa Barbara oil spill, the
                    Cuyahoga fire and the pollution of Lake Erie and
                    other Great Lakes helped galvanize
                    environmental consciousness, shift public
                    attitudes, and create the climate for federal laws
                    such as the National Environmental Policy Act of
                    1969 and the Clean Water Act of 1972.</p>
                <p>Interest in conservation increased during the
                    1960s as people became more aware of
                    pollution, endangered species, and Earth's
                    unique characteristics. The first official Earth
                    Day was held in April 1970 and included large
                    demonstrations across the country in support
                    of the environment.</p><hr>

                <h3>What were the environmental issues in the 1980s?</h3>
                <p>Acid rain was one of the defining environmental
                    issues of the 1980s, causing acid deposition in
                    streams and rivers, making them uninhabitable
                    for many species. But with increasing efforts to
                    clean up sources of acid rain, acidity levels in the
                    water had been steadily dropping.</p>
                <p>June 5-16, 1972- UN Scientific
                    Conference. As also known the first
                    Earth summit happen in Stockholm,
                    Sweden<br>Declaration raised the issue of Climate

                <p>The roots of Filipino characters are deeply 
                    intertwined with a diverse array of influences, 
                    including indigenous cultures, Malay ancestry, 
                    Spanish colonization, Chinese migration, and American 
                    colonial rule. These influences have shaped Filipino values, 
                    traditions, and identity over centuries, resulting in a unique 
                    blend of Eastern and Western elements. The resilience, hospitality, 
                    and strong sense of community are often celebrated as quintessential 
                    Filipino traits, rooted in the rich tapestry of the nation’s history 
                    and cultural heritage.

                <h2>1. Roots of  the Filipino Characters</h2>
                <img src="https://worldculturesproblemsinthephilippines.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pinoy_ako__by_neilrabi-d5dy4rr.png" class="img" width="450" height="370"><br>
                <p>The concept of the self in Filipino society is deeply influenced by notable 
                    impact of colonial history, particularly Spanish and American, which has impacted 
                    Filipino identity formation. The Filipino self is characterized by a sense of 
                    interconnectedness, collectivism, and strong ties to family and the community.
                </p><hr>
                <h3>Kinship</h3>
                <img src="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/03/03/90/90/360_F_303909058_zN7dodkF7DTVUNwkWUPcI8VcyBeyrl3h.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>Filipino kinship is a simple kinship system of defining family. Though bloodlines 
                    have their place, age is how respect is shown. Because respect has such a high value 
                    in Philippine culture, it is more important that bloodline ties. So, kinship is 
                    determined by generation and age, and to some degree by gender. 
                </p><hr>
                <h3>Religion</h3>
                <img src="https://pinasculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/evolution_of_religious_beliefs.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>Religion is the root of Filipino optimism and its capacity to accept life’s hardships. 
                    However, religion also instils in the Filipino attitudes of resignation and a pre-occupation 
                    with the afterlife. 
                </p><hr>
                <h3>Culture and Language</h3>
                <img src="https://fluentfilipino.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/main-qimg-48e5a48f7624a52a4a697e9f0352bee2.jpeg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>The Filipino culture and language serve as rich sources for developing characters in various forms 
                    of literature, film, and other media. Language allows to express self authentically through Filipino 
                    idioms, expressions, and linguistic quirks. Incorporating elements of Filipino culture and 
                    language can make characters more relatable and provide insights into the complexities of Filipino 
                    identity.
                </p><hr>
                <h3>Family</h3>

                <p>Family is considered to be the “ foundation of social life for most Filipinos”. 
                    The Nuclear family is the core family unit, however bonds are often tight knit among 
                    extended family members. 
                </p><hr>
                <h3>Educational System</h3>
                <img src="https://media.philstar.com/images/the-philippine-star/headlines/20150510/classes-start-9.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>The Filipino educational system plays a crucial role in shaping Filipino characters by instilling values, 
                    skills, and knowledge. It serves as the foundation for developing traits such as resilience, adaptability, 
                    and resourcefulness. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of family, community, and nationalism, which 
                    are integral aspects of Filipino identity. Through its curriculum and extracurricular activities, the 
                    educational system also promotes collaboration, empathy, and respect for diversity, reflecting the 
                    cultural richness of the Philippines. 
                </p><hr>

                <h2>2. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Filipino Characters</h2>
                <h3>Family and Home Environment</h3>

                <p>Child rearing can be both difficult and rewarding at the same time. The goal of every parent is to have 
                    the child grow up to be a respectable and resourceful adult in society.
                </p><hr>
                <h3>Child Rearing in the Filipino family is characterized by:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>High nurturance - the Filipino child grows up in an atmosphere of love and affection. Providing the 
                        children with the opportunity, means and support to pursue their goals.</li>
                    <li>Low independence training</li>
                    <li>Over protection - some parents act on their own needs for power and use control and coercion to ensure 
                        that they remain the dominant forces in their children’s lives.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Low discipline Attempts to maintain discipline come in the form of many "no's" and "don'ts" and a system of criticism 
                    to keep children in line. Subtle comparisons among siblings also are used by mothers to control their children.
                </p><hr>

                <ul>
                    <li>In a large family where we are encouraged to get along with our siblings and other relatives, we learn pakikipagkapwa-tao.</li>
                    <li>In an authoritarian setting we learn respect for age and authority; at the same time we become passive and 
                        dependent on authority. </li>
                </ul><hr>

                <ul><li>Family Orientation The Filipino’s family orientation may be attributed to the colonial times when the hierarchical 
                    structure of family has been in prevalent place, where age and status demand high levels of respect, and the good of the 
                    family takes precedence over personal desires. This characteristic is still present despite modern times.
                </li></ul><hr>

                <p>The social environment of the Filipino is characterized by a feudal structure with great gaps between the rich minority

                <ul>
                    <li>Traits and corresponding behavioral patterns develop because they make one more likable and enable life to proceed

                <p>Filipinos are the product of colonial history, which is regarded by many as the culprit behind our lack 
                    of nationalism and our colonial mentality. Colonialism developed a mindset in the Filipino which encouraged 
                    us to think of the colonial power as superior and more powerful.

                <h3>The Educational System</h3>

                <p>Aside from the problems inherent in the use of a foreign language in the educational system, it leads to other 
                    problems for the Filipinos.<br>

                    <b><i>“Filipinos develop a mindset that things learned in schools are not related to real life.”</i></b><br>
                </p>
                <p>Aside from the influences of the formal curriculum, there are the influences of the "hidden curriculum" i.e., 
                    the values taught informally by the Philippine school system:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Schools are highly authoritarian, with the teacher as the central focus.</li>
                    <li>The Filipino student learns passivity and conformity</li>
                    <li>The Filipino student is taught to be dependent on the teacher. Force Filipino students as well as their 
                        teachers to use school materials that are irrelevant to the Philippine setting</li>
                </ul><hr>
                <h3>The Economic Environment</h3>
                <img src="https://eastasiaforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2023-02-09T075249Z_2110657624_RC2F7Z94KF41_RTRMADP_3_PHILIPPINES-ECONOMY-scaled-1.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>Many Filipino traits are rooted in the poverty and hard life that is the lot of most Filipinos. Our difficulties 
                    drive us to take risks, impel us to work very hard, and develop in us the ability to survive. Poverty, however, 
                    has also become an excuse for graft and corruption, particularly among the lower rungs of the bureaucracy. 
                </p><hr>
                <h3>The Political Environment</h3>
                <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/08/opinion/9syjuco-inyt-web/9syjuco-inyt-web-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>The Philippine political environment is characterized by a centralization of power. Political power and authority is 
                    concentrated in the hands of the elite and the participation of most Filipinos often is limited to voting in elections. 
                    Basic services from the government are concentrated in Manila and its outlying towns and provinces. Political power is 
                    still very much concentrated in the hands of a few may lead to passivity.
                </p><hr>
                <h3>The Mass Media</h3>
                <img src="https://api.phkule.org/storage/photos/CdkpvKBAAMi1zRKnUc28pywAKr1p4escoHYWze1z.jpeg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>The tendency of media to produce escapist movies, soap operas, comics, etc., feed the Filipino's passivity. Rather than 
                    confront our poverty and oppression, we fantasize instead. The propensity to use flashy sets, designer clothes, superstars, 
                    and other bongga features reinforce porma.
                </p><hr>
                <h3>Leadership and Role Models</h3>
                <img src="https://philnews.ph/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Philippine-President-Trivia-2.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>Filipinos look up to their leaders as role models. Political leaders are the main models, but all other leaders serve as 
                    role models as well. Thus, when our leaders violate the law or show themselves to be self-serving and driven by personal 
                    interest--when there is lack of public accountability--there is a negative impact on the Filipino. 
                </p><hr>
                <h3>Filipino Value System</h3>
                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*fzoI-cuS4zn4sFsCtblx6A.jpeg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>Filipino values are the standards or principle that was set by the Filipino society which is right or wrong, the standards 
                    or principles that every member of the Filipino society should strive to attain to reach the ultimate realization of their 
                    life, regarding their person and about their family and society in general. 
                </p><hr>
