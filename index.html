                <h2>Understanding Humanities, Art, and Human Essence</h2>
                <h3>Lesson 1.1. Humanities and the Arts<br></h3>
                <p>In the age of <b>Instagram and Facebook</b>, it is very easy to come across a work of art which
                    is made, remade, or reused to fit a certain purpose or value. You must have pressed that “like” or
                    “love” button as you deem a graphic post so relatable. YouTube offers lots of tutorials and
                    techniques for painting, calligraphy, watercolor and others; lots of young artists have been
                    exposed to a wide range of art techniques because of them. Art and information is now within our
                    reach. There are so many sources available to learn from.<br><br>
                    
                    The downside of this quick information is that it is very scattered. We do not know which to prioritize and are unsure if we are getting the right information.<br>
                    
                    Art Appreciation on the other hand is a discipline offered in an academic to direct our<br>
                    
                    often ambivalent feelings toward art which is a good starting point: YOU.</p><hr>

                <p>The concept of <i>"humanity"</i> originally distinguished humans from animals and those considered
                    subhuman, such as barbarians and slaves. During the Middle Ages, a shift toward the divine
                    led to a reconsideration of humanity’s status in relation to God, emphasizing mortality rather
                    than superiority. This change influenced the rise of humanism, which balanced rationality and
                    freedom with an awareness of human fallibility, fostering responsibility and tolerance.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    With humanism’s rise, <b>artistic styles evolved through learning from, rather than imitating, the past</b>. 
                    This contrasted with the Renaissance, which sought to reconstruct historical ideals. Panofsky highlights 
                    that human existence and its records should not be seen as ends in themselves but as means for growth and 
                    understanding.
                </p><hr>
                        <h1>The Renaissance & Humanism</h1><br>
                        <img src="https://thefablesoup.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/athens.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>The Renaissance <b>(means literally as "rebirth")</b> (14th–16th centuries) was a rebirth of Greco-Roman culture, marked by renewed <b>interest in 
                    classical texts, learning, and understanding the natural world</b>. A key aspect of this period was <b>humanism, 
                    an optimistic philosophy emphasizing human potential and goodness</b>. Before the Renaissance, Christian Europeans 
                    saw humanity as sinful, but this era shifted focus to appreciating human talents as part of God’s creation. 
                    Humanism encouraged intellectual growth, personal responsibility, and artistic innovation, influencing both medieval 
                    thought and Renaissance ideals.
                </p><hr>    

                        <h1>The Northern Renaissance & Christian Humanism</h1><br>
                        <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/70/166770-050-8805ACF2/Christopher-Columbus-support-chromolithograph-Isabella-I-Spain-1884.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
                <p>The Renaissance began in <b>Italy, deeply rooted in its Greco-Roman heritage</b>. As it spread north to places like England, 
                    Germany, and Scandinavia, classical influences were less emphasized in favor of a deeper focus on Christianity, 
                    particularly its early foundations. This shift led to the rise of Christian Humanism during the Northern Renaissance.

                    Unlike earlier <b>Christian teachings that emphasized Jesus' divinity, Christian Humanism focused more on his human nature—his 
                    teachings, relationships, and suffering</b>. This perspective influenced religious thought and artistic expression across northern 
                    Europe.

                    One key result was a transformation in religious artwork. Earlier depictions of the crucifixion showed Jesus peacefully slumped 
                    over, symbolizing salvation through sacrifice. However, Christian Humanist artists portrayed him in visible agony, with a tightly 
                    twisted body, emphasizing his suffering. Those witnessing his death were depicted in deep grief, shifting the focus from salvation 
                    to the raw emotional and physical pain of the crucifixion.
                </p><hr>
                <p>Art is a human expression deeply connected to culture, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary. It explores identity, values, 
                    and emotions, allowing people to experience joy, sorrow, and clarity. Art connects the past, present, and future while being interpreted 
                    through history, anthropology, and literature. Its definition evolves with culture, making it a fluid and ever-changing concept.</p>

                <h3>Rachel Carson</h3>

                <p><b>Silent Spring is an environmental
                    science book by Rachel Carson</b>. Published
                    on <b>September 27, 1962</b>, the book
                    documented the environmental harm
                    caused by the <b>indiscriminate use
                    of pesticides</b>. Carson accused the chemical
                    industry of spreading disinformation, and
                    public officials of accepting the
                    industry's marketing claims unquestioningly.</p>
                <p>In the late 1950s, Carson focused on environmental 
                    conservation, particularly issues caused by synthetic 
                    pesticides. Her research led to Silent Spring, which <b>raised 
                    environmental concerns</b> among the American public. Despite 
                    fierce opposition from chemical companies, the book influenced 
                    public opinion, led to a U.S. <b>pesticide policy reversal</b>, a 
                    nationwide DDT ban for agricultural use, and inspired the 
                    environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S.

                <h3>Garrett Hardin</h3>

                <p>First posited in 1968 by American ecologist
                    Garret Hardin, the Tragedy of the
                    Commons describes a situation where
                    shared environmental resources are
                    overused and exploited, and eventually
                    depleted, posing risks to everyone
                    involved.</p>
                <h3>What did Garrett Hardin say about
                    the tragedy of the commons?</h3>
                <p>Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of
                    the commons that "Freedom in a commons
                    brings ruin to all." One of the proposed
                    solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate
                    access to the common.</p>
                <h3>What problem is Hardin discussing in the
                    tragedy of the commons?</h3>
                <p>Hardin wanted to address the "population problem".
                    Others want or hope to avoid the problems of
                    overpopulation without relinquishing any of the
                    privileges they now enjoy. They think that farming
                    the seas or developing new strains of wheat will
                    solve the problem--technologically.</p><hr>

                <h3>Earth day</h3>

                <p>During the 1960s, hundreds of thousands of
                    young Americans rejected the stable,
                    comfortable middle-class life their parents had
                    built in the years after World War II, driven
                    instead by a spirit of rebellion that would
                    leave a lasting impact on the nation.</p>

                <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, the environmental
                    movement focused its attention on pollution
                    and successfully pressured Congress to pass
                    measures to promote cleaner air and water. In
                    the late 1970s, the movement increasingly
                    addressed environmental threats created by
                    the disposal of toxic waste.</p>
                <p>But long hair and beards for men, tight bell-bottom
                    blue jeans and flower crowns for women, and the
                    widespread use of mind-altering drugs were only
                    the most visible, and easily dismissed, signs of this
                    ‘60s “hippie” counterculture</p>
                <p>Far more transformative were the radical social and
                    political movements that many of its adherents
                    embraced, including the civil rights movement, the
                    movement to oppose the Vietnam War and—at the
                    tail end of the 1960s and the outset of the 1970s—the

                <p>Rachel Carson’s bestselling book Silent Spring,
                    published in 1962, introduced many Americans to the
                    devastating effects of the large-scale use of
                    pesticides, especially DDT. As the 1960s continued,
                    more and more people became aware of other threats

                    Clean Air Act, the first federal emissions standards and
                    the first list of endangered species (including the bald
                    eagle, America’s national symbol). These laws were a
                    start, but they did not go far enough to address the
                    serious environmental problems facing the nation.</p><br>
                <h3>Images of the 1969 oil spil in Santa Barbara, California fueled outrage over environmental issues.</h3>

                <p>In January 1969, the Union Oil well in Santa Barbara,
                    California spilled more than 200,000 gallons of oil into the
                    Pacific Ocean over 11 days. That June, oil and chemicals
                    floating on the surface of the Cuyahoga River in Ohio burst
                    into flames. Images of such disasters, broadcast across the
                    country, helped fuel a growing outrage over the state of the
                    environment, especially among young radicals.</p>
                <h3>What environmental disasters of the 1960s
                    and 70s led to the creation of
                    environmental laws in the US?</h3>
                <p>Along with the Santa Barbara oil spill, the
                    Cuyahoga fire and the pollution of Lake Erie and
                    other Great Lakes helped galvanize
                    environmental consciousness, shift public
                    attitudes, and create the climate for federal laws
                    such as the National Environmental Policy Act of
                    1969 and the Clean Water Act of 1972.</p>
                <p>Interest in conservation increased during the
                    1960s as people became more aware of
                    pollution, endangered species, and Earth's
                    unique characteristics. The first official Earth
                    Day was held in April 1970 and included large
                    demonstrations across the country in support
                    of the environment.</p><hr>

                <h3>What were the environmental issues in the 1980s?</h3>
                <p>Acid rain was one of the defining environmental
                    issues of the 1980s, causing acid deposition in
                    streams and rivers, making them uninhabitable
                    for many species. But with increasing efforts to
                    clean up sources of acid rain, acidity levels in the
                    water had been steadily dropping.</p>
                <p>June 5-16, 1972- UN Scientific
                    Conference. As also known the first
                    Earth summit happen in Stockholm,
                    Sweden<br>Declaration raised the issue of Climate
                    Change for the first time.</p>

                <p>
                    User experience design (UXD, UED, or XD) is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the
                    usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product.  
                    User experience design encompasses traditional human–computer interaction (HCI) design, and extends it by addressing
                    all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users ..
